Like the title says, this challenge IS DANGEROUS AND CONTAINS LIVE MALWARE.

Shoutout to the hacker that I stole this from challenge from. Sadly I can't give them credit because they sent the phish from a compromised email, but it's literally his/her code. I just defanged it (a little bit - IT WILL STILL CRASH YOUR WEBBROWSER (usually, but don't test that outside of a VM)) and stuck a WPI flag in here.

To prevent accidental execution the file has been zipped with the password "I_understand_that_this_challenge_contains_LIVE_MALWARE"
